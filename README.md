# webpack-server

This is a simple boilerplate for static sites, React projects, and using ES6.  It uses Gulp for HTML and CSS compilation, and Webpack for JavaScript minification and bundling.

## Setup

1. Install node modules.
  ```js
    $ npm install
  ```
  
2. Install Bower components.
  ```js
    $ bower install
  ```
  
3. Run Gulp to compile HTML and CSS.
  ```js
    $ gulp
  ```
  
4. Run webpack-dev-server.
  ```js
    $ npm start
  ```

## Production

1. Replace JS source in HTML to minified version.

2. Compile HTML and CSS.
  ```js
    $ gulp build
  ```

3. Compile JavaScript with Webpack.
  ```js
    $ npm run build
  ```
# webpack
